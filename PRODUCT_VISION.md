# Product Vision — MCAT Access Platform

## Vision Statement
To create an equitable, adaptive MCAT study platform that helps students turn **the resources they already have** and **the time they actually live with** into a realistic, effective study plan.

This platform does not sell content.  
It **coordinates**, **prioritizes**, and **adapts** learning around real life.

## The Problem

Preparing for the MCAT is expensive, rigid, and often unrealistic for students who:
- work part-time or full-time jobs
- take heavy course loads
- support family members
- lack access to expensive prep programs

Most MCAT tools:
- assume unlimited time
- lock students into proprietary content
- provide static plans that fall apart when life happens
- show performance data without actionable guidance

Students often already own or use:
- Kaplan books
- Jack Westin CARS
- Blueprint videos
- Khan Academy
- Anki decks
- Personal notes

What they lack is **coordination**.

## Core Product Philosophy

### 1. Resource-Agnostic
Users bring their own content:
- Kaplan, Princeton Review, Blueprint
- Jack Westin
- Khan Academy
- YouTube videos
- Anki decks
- Personal notes or PDFs

The platform never restricts access behind paywalls.

---

### 2. Life-Aware
Study plans must account for:
- classes
- labs
- jobs
- caregiving
- missed days

Schedules are adjustable and repairable, not fragile.

---

### 3. Adaptive, Not Rigid
Plans update based on:
- user performance
- missed tasks
- changing availability

Users can manually drag and reschedule tasks while the system adapts intelligently.

---

### 4. Explainable Intelligence
Recommendations are:
- transparent
- deterministic
- understandable

The system explains *why* something is scheduled next.

---

## What This Product Is (and Is Not)

### This product **is**:
- a coordination and planning system
- a personalization engine
- an adaptive study workflow

### This product **is not**:
- a content vendor
- a replacement for Anki or commercial prep
- an AI tutor
- a source of copyrighted materials

---

## Why This Matters

This platform lowers barriers to MCAT preparation by:
- maximizing the value of existing resources
- respecting real-world constraints
- reducing burnout from unrealistic schedules
- empowering students to recover when they fall behind

It supports **equity in the medical pipeline** through better software, not better marketing.
